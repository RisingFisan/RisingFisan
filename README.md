# Sofia Santos

Hello there! 👋😊 I'm Sofia (she/her) and I'm a student at University of Minho, where I'm getting a degree in Software Engineering 👩‍💻. 

## About me 💜

I was born and raised in Braga 🇵🇹, where I currently live and study. I love sci-fi stuff 👾, LEGO 🧱 and pizza 🍕, among other things. I'm a bit of an introvert, but I still really enjoy hanging out with friends 👩‍🤝‍👩, and during my alone time I like to listen to music 🎵, play some video games 🎮, or just watch something on Netflix 🍿.

I use arch btw 😳, here are my [dotfiles](https://github.com/RisingFisan/dotfiles)! There are also a couple of small scripts there, some of which I made from scratch.
